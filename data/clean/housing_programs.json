Each year one Commissioner&rsquo;s term expires and serves until a replacement has been provided. Commissioners serve without compensation and cannot serve on any other Town governmental body, either elected or appointed Board or Commission.  The Elderly and Disabled Housing Program consists of 112 units; 60 of which are located at Millbrook Village on Mack Street and 52 located at&nbsp; Shad Run Terrace on Henry Street. This program receives no operating funds from either the Town of Windsor or the State of Connecticut. All operating revenues for this program are derived solely from tenant rents. Each year an annual operating budget is prepared and submitted to the Connecticut Department of Economic Development, the State&rsquo;s oversight agency. Once approved, this budget provides the basis for the successful operation of the program for the ensuing year.  Selection of tenants into the Elderly and Disabled Housing Program is based on upon two major factors--income and specific eligibility. Because this program was established to benefit the local community, Windsor residents are given special preference.  1. Income: The Connecticut Department of Economic Development periodically establishes maximum admission income limits for admission to Elderly and Disabled Housing. Current limits apply. 2. Eligibility: To meet this requirement, tenants must be sixty-two years of age or older or a person that has been certified by the Social Security Board as being totally disabled under the Federal Social Security Act.  The Section 8 Rental Assistance Program is an outreach to families that subsidizes rent payments to landlords. This is a federal program that is completely funded by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Housing Authority of the Town of Windsor receives a fee for each voucher issued. This fee is used to offset costs for the administration and management of the program. Dwelling units are located throughout the Town of Windsor with tenants having a choice of housing that is suitable to their needs. Prior to entering into a Housing Assistance Payment contract, an inspection of the apartment to be rented is made by the Housing Authority. Any deficiencies noted must be corrected before the Tenant is allowed to lease the apartment. No apartment is placed under contract with the Housing Authority of the Town of Windsor that fails to meet DHUD&rsquo;s Housing Quality Standards or Rent Reasonableness. Annual inspections of apartments under contract are made by a representative of the Housing Authority to ensure compliance with DHUD Housing Quality Standards and Rent Reasonableness. Participating landlords are paid directly by the Housing Authority of the Town of Windsor the difference between the fair market value rent and the amount that the tenant can afford without exceeding 30% of their annual income.

Allen-O&rsquo;Neill Homes  Allen-O&rsquo;Neill Homes, a state Moderate Rental Housing development, consists of 41 single-family homes and one 12-unit apartment building. The housing was completed in 1953 and was built on the site of the former Fitch Home for Soldiers and their Orphans, a home for veterans of the Civil War and Spanish-American War.  During WWII the Fitch property was used as a Naval Communications Training Center and contained some Quonset huts, which were used for housing for a time after the War. Today, most of the original buildings from the Fitch estate are gone; however, the chapel was moved across the street and remodeled to become Darien&rsquo;s VFW Post 6933. Several of the original houses are on West Avenue and are privately owned, and the current apartment building at 20 Allen-O&rsquo;Neill Drive was remodeled from one of the Fitch buildings. Old Town Hall Houses  Old Town Hall Houses is a State of Connecticut Low Income Elderly Housing project completed in 1988. Located at 719 Post Road in Darien, the senior housing is on the site of the former Darien Town Hall (which was the original Royle School building.) Old Town Hall Houses consists of 30 apartments (20 one-bedroom units, including four which are handicap accessible and 10 efficiency units). There is also a Community Building containing a large meeting room, a small office and laundry facilities.  The Housing Authority is governed by a five-member Board of Commissioners, and the projects are managed by an Executive Director and staff in accordance with State Regulations. Allen-O&rsquo;Neill Redevelopment  The Darien Housing Authority is currently planning for the future redevelopment of the ten + acre site of Allen-O&rsquo;Neill Homes. During 2006 and 2007, the Town of Darien granted $200,000 to the Darien Housing Authority to undertake predevelopment studies and activities related to the improvement of the site. \r Housing Authority Hours: Open Monday-Friday, 9:00 a.m. &ndash; 4:00 p.m., closed Holidays ", "address": "2 Renshaw Road", "city": "Darien", "county": "Fairfield County", "state": "connecticut", "zip": "06820", "phone": "203-655-0866", "web": "https://www.shelterlistings.org/details/36459/", "latitude": 41.05, "longitude": -73.47, "facebook": "", "type": "shelter", "short_info": ""}, {"id": "36524", "name": "Woodstock CT Housing Authority", "description": " Housing Authority.

Public housing comes in all sizes and types, from scattered single family houses to high rise apartments for elderly families. There are approximately 1.2 million households living in public housing units, managed by some 3,300 HAs. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) administers Federal aid to local housing agencies (HAs) that manage the housing for low-income residents at rents they can afford. HUD furnishes technical and professional assistance in planning, developing and managing these developments. Who is Eligible?  Public housing is limited to low-income families and individuals. A HA determines your eligibility based on:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; annual gross income &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whether you qualify as elderly, a person with a disability, or as a family &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; U.S. citizenship or eligible immigration status; criminal background report; and sex offender registrant status  If you are eligible, the HA will check your references to make sure you and your family will be good tenants. HAs will deny admission to any applicant whose habits and practices may be expected to have a detrimental effect on other tenants or on the project's environment.  HAs use income limits developed by HUD. HUD sets the lower income limits at 80%, very low income limits at 50% of the median income, and extremely low income limits at 30% for the county or metropolitan area in which you choose to live. Income limits vary from area to area so you may be eligible at one HA but not at another. The HA serving your community can provide you with the income levels for your area and family size, or you can also find the income limits here on the internet. How do I apply?  If you are interested in applying for public housing, please contact the HAB at (502) 348-3525.

They're administered by various city and state public housing authorities. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) oversees the use of federal PHA programs by those cities and states. Today's programs can trace their history back to the government's initial efforts undertaken during the Great Depression.  The Housing Authority of Dry Ridge is one of two Public Housing Authorities (PHA's) in Grant County. In 1937, the U.S. Housing Act established permanent public housing funded by the federal government. Public housing was established to provide decent and safe rental housing for eligible low-income families, the elderly, and persons with disabilities. Public housing comes in all sizes and types, from scattered single family houses to high-rise apartments for elderly families. There are approximately 1.2 million households living in public housing units, managed by some 3,300 HAs. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) administers Federal aid to local housing agencies (HAs) that manage the housing for low-income residents at rents they can afford. HUD furnishes technical and professional assistance in planning, developing and managing these developments.  The Housing Authority of Dry Ridge has been serving the Dry Ridge community by providing and developing quality affordable housing opportunities for individuals and families while promoting self-sufficiency and empowerment since 1983. The Housing Authority of Dry Ridge (HADR), is a tax-exempt, non-profit, municipal corporation, governed by a Board nominated by the Mayor and confirmed by the City Commission. The agency is responsible for the development and management of federally subsidized housing in the Dry Ridge area.  HUD relies on local HAs to determine eligibility for public housing assistance. Factors determining such eligibility include an applicant's gross annual income. In addition, HAs will look at whether the applicant is elderly, has a disability or heads a family. Lastly, HAs are charged with determining an applicant's citizenship status. Only U.S. citizens or eligible immigrants are allowed to receive PHA. HAs also conduct background checks on applicants to ensure they'll be good tenants.

The U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) administers federal aid to local housing agencies to manage the housing for residents at affordable rents. \r  How Do I Apply? Simply visit the Management office for the development (whose wait list is open) and request an application or visit the St. Louis Housing Authority (SLHA) and request an application for Public Housing. \r &nbsp; \r ection 8 How do I know when the Section 8 Wait List is open? St. Lousing Authority will disclose this information over the phone. We also post the information as a Public Notice at our Central Office and place advertisements in the public notice section of the local newspapers. \r  What information will I need to provide on the Section 8 application? You will need to provide information on family composition, household income, social security numbers, and dates of birth for all members of the household. \r  What happens when my name comes to the top of the wait list? You will be sent an appointment letter by mail to attend an eligibility session. Your income will be calculated to ensure that you are eligible to receive assistance. \r  When will I be issued the Voucher? It will take approximately 12-18 months from the time of application to be issued a voucher. \r  How much time do I have to find a unit? Each client is given 60 days initially to locate housing.

Its purpose is to provide safe, clean and affordable housing for families and individuals. YMHA manages five family communities and six senior communities along with a few scattered sites throughout Mahoning County. Our communities are more than just buildings. We provide activities, programs and services for comfortable living.  Public Housing Applications may be taken at the Central Office, 131 W. Boardman Street, Youngstown, Ohio 44503, from Monday - Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 4:30 p.m., or any other YMHA satellite office. Once the Application is complete, you will be scheduled for a Briefing. During this process, you will be required to submit certain verifications for all family members, such as income, birth certificates, social security cards, landlord references and other information deemed necessary by our Application Specialists.     Housing Choice Voucher Program  The Housing Choice Voucher Program assists low-income families in Mahoning County to rent privately owned homes and apartments. The program is funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). YMHA contracts with HUD as the local provider for Mahoning County. Under the program, a portion of the participants' rent is paid by YMHA to the landlord and the participant is responsible for paying the remaining portion. The choice of where to live is up to the participant, as long as the unit meets the requirements of the program. All units with a voucher holder in residence is inspected by YMHA to make sure it is in decent, safe and sanitary condition.  YMHA maintains a Waiting List for all applicants for the Housing Choice Voucher program.&nbsp; New applications are only accepted once the Waiting List is open.&nbsp; When the Waiting List is open, instructions on how to submit an application are advertised in the local newspaper.&nbsp; At the end of the application period, a random computer generated drawing selects applications for placement on the Wait List.   YMHA contacts applicants by mail when their position has been reached on the Waiting List. At that time, an interview session is scheduled. Applicants must bring all required information with them to the interview.&nbsp; Due to the large number of applicants on the Waiting list, there is no way to estimate how long an applicant may be waiting until their name is reached on the Waiting list.  We receive many applications; therefore, it may take some time to reach all applicants with news of the status of their applications. Applicants are encouraged to call YMHA at any time to check their status.  FAQ &nbsp;How do I apply for the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program?  Answer:  YMHA will publish announcements in the local newspapers indicating the dates and times applications may be submitted.   &nbsp;How do I apply for the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program?

Public housing comes in all sizes and types, from scattered single family houses to high-rise apartments for elderly families. There are approximately 1.2 million households living in public housing units, managed by some 3,300 Housing Authorities. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) administers Federal aid to local housing agencies (HAs) that manage the housing for low-income residents at rents they can afford. HUD furnishes technical and professional assistance in planning, developing and managing these developments. \r Public Housing is limited to low - income families and individuals with or without a disability. The Housing Authority of the City of Charleston determines your eligibility based on: 1) annual gross income; 2) whether you qualify as elderly, or a person with a disability, or as a family; and 3) U.S. citizenship or eligible immigration status. \r The Housing Authority of the City of Charleston (CHA) has income limits developed by HUD. HUD sets the lower income limits at 80% and very low income limits at 50% of the median income for the county or metropolitan area in which you choose to live. Income limits vary from area to area so you may be eligible at one HA but not at another. The HA serving your community can provide you with the income levels for your area and family size. \r  For more information: www.huduser.org \r  If you are eligible, CHA will perform criminal background and background checks to make sure you and your family will be suitable tenants. HAs will deny admission to any applicant whose habits and practices may be expected to have a detrimental effect on other tenants or in the housing complex's environment. When applications are being accepted, a pre-application can be obtained online at www.chacity.org or can be obtained at the Housing Authority's Housing Resource office during scheduled times announced on our website. If the CHA determines that you are eligible, your name will be put on a waiting list. Once your name begins approaching the top of the waiting list, the CHA will contact you to complete a full application. If it is determined that you are ineligible, the HA must say why and, if you wish, you can request an informal hearing.

Section 8 rental assistance programs are federal programs funded through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and administered by Charleston-Kanawha Housing. These include the Housing Choice Voucher program, which is tenant-based assistance (assistance travels with a family), and the Moderate Rehabilitation Program, which is unit-based assistance (a family has assistance as long as they reside in a unit). Families cannot use a voucher in a Mod Rehab unit.  Families are responsible for finding their own housing and paying a portion (30%) of their monthly income toward rent and utilities. Charleston-Kanawha Housing makes up the difference between the cost and the families contribution.  The public housing program offers tenants a home in communities managed by Charleston-Kanawha Housing. The rent they pay is based on 30% of their monthly-adjusted income and all basic utilities are paid.  Charleston-Kanawha Housing manages six family communities and four high-rise communities as well as scattered sites throughout the city of Charleston.
