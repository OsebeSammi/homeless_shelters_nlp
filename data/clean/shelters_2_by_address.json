As part of the strategic plan to end homelessness in Pierce County and to design a \"best practice\" model to serve homeless households, Associated Ministries, in partnership with Catholic Community Services, Greater Lakes Mental Health Care and Comprehensive Life Resources, has contracted with Pierce County to provide coordinated entry for homeless households.  As part of AP4H, a Coordinated Entry Specialist will work one-on-one with individuals to enable stability.

The idea of mandating services in order to have the basic human right of housing has proven to be ineffective. It causes individuals and families more harm than good.  In our program, we meet the clients where they are in life. This program is all about what the clients want and need. They are in charge of their destinies and know their situation better than we do.

Shelter:  Many homeless men live in fear of being robbed or physically attacked, and extreme temperatures can make sleeping on the streets further dangerous. That's why providing safe, clean shelter for their overnight guests is so important.  Doing so gives hope to their guests, and communicates God's love to them in a practical way. To create a physically safe environment for all of their guests, they do not tolerate violence of any kind, nor do they allow drugs, alcohol, or weapons in the building.  Any guest bringing these into their facility is immediately required to leave so that they can maintain a safe environment for everyone else. When their shelter beds are full, particularly on cold nights, they set up over 100 additional temporary beds in their chapel and an additional 100 temporary beds at their Opportunity Center.  Food:  Every day of the year, the Mission provides breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Each year, they provide over 313,000 meals for the hungry. Lunch is free and open to the public.  Lunch guests should arrive no later than 11 a.m.  Dinner is reserved for overnight guests.  Day Shelter:  Being on the streets can be dangerous, so they do what they can to encourage homeless individuals to stay off the streets and come into their facilities to get help. One way they do so is by keeping their Emergency Shelter at 383 Poplar Ave. and their Opportunity Center at 600 Poplar Ave. open to the public during the day.  This allows guests to access their services, and helps to discourage loitering.  Clothing:  A clean set of clothing can restore a homeless person's sense of dignity, and can enable them to gain employment.  That's why they keep their clothes closet full of fresh shirts, pants, shoes, socks, underwear, coats, and accessories. Memphis Union Mission does not operate a thrift store, and clothing is provided at no charge.  Extended Stay:  Men who are employed or receiving disability are eligible to stay on an extended-stay basis at their Opportunity Center at 600 Poplar Ave. This facility features smaller, quieter dorm rooms and a positive environment for those who have demonstrated greater initiative and responsibility.

The HousingWorks approach is simple: give chronically homeless individuals what they need most - a safe, stable, affordable home - and then provide the wrap-around support to help them remain housed and regain lives of wellness and dignity. A team of social workers, therapists, a full-time nurse and a part-time psychiatrist provide supportive services to help each HousingWorks tenant manage the transition from long-term homelessness to housing, and to help individuals meet personal goals to ensure they never become homeless again.  HousingWorks specifically targets those individuals who have been homeless the longest, are the most vulnerable and are the most frequent users of emergency rooms, jails, shelters and other costly crisis services.

FAQ's  What does it mean to \"make a disciple?\"  It means to teach others about the Jesus of the Holy Bible. We believe the Bible to be the Holy word of God. That means we believe God wrote the Bible using inspired men and all of it is true.  The Bible says that Jesus became sin for us and bore our sins in His body on the tree (the cross), healing our wounds (otherwise known as our sin) and giving Himself as a ransom for all men (1 Timothy 2:5-6), 1 Peter 2:24). The Bible says whoever believes this in his heart and professes Jesus as Lord through his mouth, is saved (Romans 10:9). God calls us to follow Him and teach others to do the same (Matthew 28:20).  We believe this, try to model it through our behavior and teach this through Bible study at HPM.   Who does HPM accommodate?  HPM accommodates homeless or near homeless men willing to let God transform their lives into the live He intended. We have an application and interview process to determine who is right for HPM.   What is the process for new residents?  When a new resident enters the ministry they are first given a room and a bed. Until they are working, we provide food as well. Then we provide what a resident needs. If it is cloths, they get them. If a job, we work with them to obtain employment. If they need medical assistance, we direct them wherever they need to go and help them get help. If they need government help, we try to assist them down the administrative paths. We'll also help them achieve additional education from recognized institution or achieve various other goals as we are able.   Do you charge rent?  No, Hoskins Park Ministries does not charge rent. We provide furnished houses for the residents. There is a nominal program fee. It should be noted, however, that often times a resident requires a period of grace before they can pay that amount."}], "address": "107 Cromer St.", "city": "Charlotte", "county": "", "state": "NC", "zip": "28104", "phone": "(704) 391-3303", "web": "", "latitude": "", "longitude": "", "facebook": "", "type": "shelter", "short_info": ""}, "1100 Buffalo Road, Rochester, NY, USA": {"name": "Cleveland County Rescue Mission - Men's Division", "description": [{"title": "Cleveland County Rescue Mission - Men's Division", "description": "The Cleveland County Rescue Mission incorporates a holistic approach to recovery, addressing the needs of the mind, body, and soul.

In phase one, we expect each man to commit to 90 days here at Crossroads. Men attend chapel twice a day with phase one classes for sixty minutes each morning. Through the day men are assigned various jobs depending on their particular skill sets; everything from maintenance and green-house workers, cooks, warehouse workers, to thrift store helpers. Phase-one classes focus on recovery and providing the basics needed to begin a personal walk with the Lord and successful Christian living. We encourage each resident to continue to the second phase of our program, \"The Sons of God.\" This is an intense, six month study, presented in a fast-paced, challenging, learning environment. Men enrolled in the Sons of God program are held to a higher standard of accountability and are used as encouragers to the new residents. The courses deliver the equivalent of a first year of Bible college curriculum. Upon graduation, phase three emphasizes preparing a resident for self sufficiency. Attention is given to financial planning, family life, job skills, and continuing education.

An overnight volunteer is available to distribute hygiene products, distribute laundry detergent to those who need it, and to simply be present to those in crisis.  Overflow Emergency Shelter On cold nights, on rainy nights, on weekends, where does one go when all shelters, including First Lights emergency shelter, are full? The overflow emergency shelter was born from necessity. We now provide mats, pillows and clean linens 15-20 guests nightly.  Permanent Housing Programs HUD 4th Floor Permanent Supportive Housing First Lights fourth floor is home for nine guests with severe mental illness who are unlikely to successfully live independently.  HUD Permanent Supportive Housing Programs Approximately fifty program participants who were chronically homeless or have disabling conditions have been housed in apartments in Bessemer, Birmingham, Homewood and other metro areas through three programs. (Bessemer HUD, HUD East and Noah's Ark) The participants are provided intensive support from their Permanent Supportive Housing Social Worker.  Shelter Plus Care Permanent Supportive Housing Program Shelter Plus Care is a collaboration between First Light and the Jefferson County Housing Authority through which housing and supportive care is provided to women who are homeless due to a disabling condition, such as mental illness, past substance abuse or HIV/AIDS. They are provided with intensive support from our Shelter Plus Care Social Worker and she helps with annual renewals for this voucher based program.  Forever Home Forever Home is a new program to quickly rehouse First Light emergency shelter guests with children who are likely to achieve independence with limited intervention, thereby freeing up beds and social services for guests at First Lights emergency shelter who have more complex issues. Forever Home families get diminishing financial support and the social services they need to help the adult female head of the family maintain employment and build savings to prevent ordiminish the physical, cognitive, psychological and emotional damage of homelessness to themselves and their children.  Project Healthy Minds This is a comprehensive program which addresses the overall health and well-being of all of our guests. It includes group and individual counseling sessions, assistance with securing diagnoses and medications, (as well as keeping them organized with weekly med box fills on Friday mornings,) and transportation assistance when necessary.  Day Programs This category entails the numerous activities offered to First Light guests by outside volunteers. They range from makeovers to Bible Studies to field trips.  If you need emergency shelter, calling 205-323-4277 is the fastest and most effective way to get the information and help you need.       Emergency Shelter  The second floor of First Light houses the emergency shelter. It is a dorm-like environment with 36 beds, a family room and a volunteer room. A metal locker accompanies each bed, which allows our guests to remove all their possessions from the typical carrying case a large plastic garbage bag, to secure them in a neat and clean place.When guests \"arrives\" in the shelter, they open a locker door to find clean linens, a pillow, blankets and a towel. The first action is usually to make the bed, fluff the pillow and place any special personal items on the bed to make feel like home. This might include a Bible, a photo of a loved one, or stuffed animals. This promotes settling into what may be \"home\" for several months. Nightly overnight overnight volunteers are present to distribute laundry detergent and whatever hygiene products are needed. All of these items- the linens, the towels, the hygiene products, the toiletries- have been donated by complete strangers. These strangers are the lifeblood of First Light."}], "address": "2230 Fourth Avenue", "city": "North Birmingham", "county": "", "state": "AL", "zip": "35203", "phone": "205-323-4277 ", "web": "", "latitude": "", "longitude": "", "facebook": "", "type": "shelter", "short_info": ""}, "1321 7th Avenue North, Birmingham, AL, USA": {"name": "Hope House Residential Youth Shelter", "description": [{"title": "Hope House Residential Youth Shelter", "description": "Family Connection is a multi-service non-profit agency dedicated to building positive futures for the community's most vulnerable children, youth and families.

Rescue Programs The Foundry's Rescue Program provides assistance to marginalized members of our community men, women and children who are lost, hurting and feel they are unloved. A hot meal, a kind word or a burden lifted can be the beginning of a new outlook on life, and we offer all that and more through this ministry of compassion. We address the urgent needs of the homeless and those who are struggling to provide for themselves and their families through nutritious meals, food boxes, clothing and other vital resources.   Homelessness, hunger and heartache can become harsh realities for men who are addicted. Self-destructive habits may have cost them their jobs and they can no longer afford a place to live. Or theyve been asked to leave their homes because of the negative impact their lifestyle is having on their families. Their health also suffers as their behaviors lead to a dangerous disregard for nutrition, and theyre often unaware of how theyre abusing their bodies and minds. Regardless of the roles they once might have held as fathers or professionals, day-to-day survival now becomes their lifes sole purpose.  While society often labels them 'addicts,' women who battle substance abuse are first and foremost daughters, sisters, wives and, in many cases, mothers. Somewhere along the wayoften at a very young agethey took a wrong turn, made a poor choice or sought comfort in a substance that took control of their lives and put their futures at risk, often costing them their livelihoods, their families and their homes. Although addiction can result in homelessness for both genders, women on the streets face a different form of danger. They may be forced to stay with 'friends,' sometimes selling their bodies to survive. This unfortunate situation not only destroys their dignity and self-worth, it also puts them at risk for disease, assault and even death. The tragic consequences affect not only the women themselves, but also the people close to them as lives are shattered, potentials are lost and families are ripped apart.

PATH, located in the Bronx, is a state-of-the-art and eco-friendly facility that has been specifically sized, staffed, and laid out to meet the demand for homeless services. At nearly 77,000 square feet, the Leadership in Energy  Environmental Design (LEED)-certified facility measures 213 percent larger than the previous intake center. With a discreetly located medical suite, storage availability, and spacious waiting areas on each floor, complete with security kiosks and audio-visual notification systems, the center aims to engage clients and make them feel secure in their surroundings, from entry to departure.     PATH DHS Assessment Shelter    PATH is open 24 hours per day, including weekends and holidays.       PATH processes applications during business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.)     What do families need to bring to PATH in order to apply for shelter? All families who are applying for shelter at PATH must have proper identification for all members of their household, such as:   Any form of ID with a picture and proof of age, such as a welfare ID card, green card, driver's license, passport or visa, or picture employment card   Birth certificate   Social Security card   Medicaid card   Identity card in the Public Assistance system   If working, your most recent pay stub   Family workers are available on-site to help families obtain necessary information and documents from government agencies and third parties, to the extent reasonably possible. What if I dont speak English? Interpreter assistance will be made available for individuals who do not speak English. What is involved with the application process at PATH? Families with children must apply for shelter in order to ensure that they do not have an alternative housing option available to them. DHS firmly believes that families are best served in their communities through prevention efforts, and that they should only utilize temporary emergency shelter as a last resort when they are experiencing an immediate housing crisis.  Once a family arrives at PATH, they will first be interviewed by a Human Resources Administration (HRA) caseworker, who will inquire about their living situation and explain the services that may help them avoid entering shelter- including family mediation, anti-eviction legal services, out-of-city relocation assistance, Family Eviction Prevention Supplement (FEPS), or a one-shot deal through HRA.  If these services do not apply to a familys specific circumstances, a DHS family worker interviews the family to obtain information about their prior living situation. Families may be assigned a temporary shelter placement for up to 10 days while DHS investigates the information provided during the interview. Based on the investigation, DHS determines whether the family is eligible or ineligible for shelter, based on whether they have fully cooperated with the application and eligibility process and/or have other housing options available to them."}], "address": "151 East 151st Street", "city": "Bronx", "county": "", "state": "NY", "zip": "10451", "phone": "(718) 503-6400", "web": "", "latitude": "", "longitude": "", "facebook": "", "type": "shelter", "short_info": ""}, "1032 Beach 19th Street, Far Rockaway, Queens, NY, USA": {"name": "United Methodist Center in Far Rockaway", "description": [{"title": "United Methodist Center in Far Rockaway", "description": "The Mission currently gives out pantry twice a week and is currently the only organization serving hot meals five days a week.

Washington Street, Champaign                 The Phoenix Daytime Drop-In center  is the centerpiece of our ministry, bringing our friends without an address together with our friends from the community. We are open from noon-5pm, every Tuesday-Friday, and we welcome you to join us. Located at 70 E. Washington Street in Champaign, The Phoenix is a casual, welcoming space with a living room, computers, board games, musical instruments, and most importantly, companionship. We invite you to join us this week. Youre sure to make new friends while you learn more about the challenges and victories facing those who dont have a bed to sleep in tonight.    C-U at Home operates a six bed Men's Recovery House, a two bed Women's House, a three-bed \"Step-Above\" house, and small Family House.  Residents stay for 6-12 months and are provided with weekly case management and a spiritual adviser. Our goal with each resident is to support, encourage, and mentor them so that they can successfully become more independent, self-sufficient, and enjoy a stable life on their own in the future.  Our application process is generally a three step process, involving a C-U at Home employee and professional case worker. Following these steps, our Housing Team will determine whether or not the program would be a good fit for the individual. If you would like to begin this process, please call our Housing Coordinator at 217-888-0329.  In an effort to stay true to our empowerment model, we ask that all residents pay a small program fee while living in the C-U at Home houses. This fee is on a sliding scale depending on how many hours the individual works in a given week. If the resident is not working, no program fees are required but searching for employment is a requirement.  Our residents go to work each week, meet with a professional case worker, spiritual adviser and attend recovery meetings that are suited to the individual (as outlined in final agreement).  Each resident is asked to enter into a 6-12 month agreement with C-U at Home. We feel that in that time, the resident can begin to develop the skills needed to live independently and gain a feeling of self sufficiency. Since each resident is required to save a percentage of their earning with each paycheck, this time period also allows the residents to save up anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars. Residents may be allowed to stay for a shorter or longer amount of time but these would be handled on a case-by-case basis.Emergency Shelter Transitional Housing - Family"}], "address": "70 East Washington", "city": "Champaign", "county": "", "state": "IL", "zip": "61820", "phone": "(217) 819-4569", "web": "", "latitude": "", "longitude": "", "facebook": "", "type": "shelter", "short_info": ""}, "2212 N Market St, Champaign, IL, USA": {"name": "Salvation Army Stepping Stone Program and Daytime Warming Center", "description": [{"title": "Salvation Army Stepping Stone Program and Daytime Warming Center", "description": "The Stepping Stone Program will house men, women and families who present as homeless and who commit to working the program.

When a family moves into one of our shelters they sign an agreement with BCHG to design and then implement a plan that moves them towards permanent housing. The Supportive Housing Program (SHP) staff and client families work together as a team to set and accomplish the goals each family needs to meet in order to live independently. This plan may include additional schooling or job trainings. It may be a plan which is focused on saving money while employed. Whatever the case may be, the client family drives the planning, and our staff is simply present to support the family as needed.   Bridge  Home Stabilization Programs  When families complete a stay at a BCHG Supportive Housing Program site, they may need more time to accomplish the goals they hope to meet. At that point, families may be referred to the Bridge and Home Stabilization Program. The Bridge and Home Stabilization programs are intended to provide subsidized rental assistance and social services to homeless families with at least one child under the age of 18. Both programs provide housing in scattered-site rental properties. The program accommodates approximately 50 families at a time. Rental subsidy and social services are provided and families may choose to maintain those apartments independently when they complete the program.

Light of Life's Food and Emergency Shelter, Samaritan Ministries, provides critical services to help meet immediate needs and start a relationship with men and women who need help.  They are able to provide food, shelter and hope by offering opportunities for case management, long-term care and connections to other service providers. Light of Life's Housing and Employment is a unique program designed to equip men who are homeless to gain housing, employment and stability in their lives.  With a capacity to serve up to eight clients at a time, this program addresses the needs of men who, for various reasons, are not suited for a year-long residential recovery program.  By committing to case management, a man enrolled in the program receives sleeping quarters and personal storage in a private area of the men's shelter. During a man's stay in this program Light of Life will provide him case management, educational resources and connections to critical services, such as housing, job, medical and other programs. Light of Life embraces single mothers and their children whose lives have been deeply impacted by homelessness, addiction and abuse.  The women enter their Christian recovery program after having received residential recovery services through other area agencies.  During their 9-18 month program, the women are provided with subsidized apartments, assistance with transportation, household and childcare needs, and 20 hours per week of counseling, education and training.  They also engage in family retreats and activities to help them realize their potential as responsible, loving parents. Most women entering the program are healing from abuse, addiction and poverty, which have made it nearly impossible for them to wholly fulfill their role as a parent.  Many have lost custody of their children and deeply desire to have them back in a safe, loving home.  Therefore, an important aspect of women's recovery focuses on parenting skills and strengthening the family unit.  Moms also benefit from training in household management and activities designed to re-establish bonds with their children.

The congregations provide meals, shower facilities, transportation and, when able, laundry services for our guests. During our guests' stay, case managers work with each individual and family to develop and implement a personalized housing plan that concentrates on overcoming barriers to self-reliance such as lack of income, poor money management, mental health issues, substance abuse, and a broken personal support system. Throughout its 26 years, MCREST has provided emergency shelter yearly to over 500 adults and 100 children. This is our core service and definitely our strength. It is a great accomplishment to coordinate and sustain this program through a network of 90 churches for 26 years. This aligns with the goal of providing safe emergency shelter for homeless individuals and families for up to 90 days through a network of congregations across Macomb County and the goal of developing a personalized housing plan that concentrates on overcoming barriers to self-reliance through case management.   Supportive Housing Programs    Journey Home  Locates safe, affordable rental housing and provides the security deposit and a portion of the first year's rent for children and their families who have income, a reasonable prospect to resume future rental payments and agree to accept case management services working towards self-reliance. Once accepted into the program, a Case Manger will assist the family to locate affordable housing based on their projected future income and MCREST will provide the security deposit and rental assistance up to three months. A Case Manager will continue to implement the Housing Plan which serves as the foundation for resource coordination to address the barriers that lead to homelessness. To participate in Journey Home, the family must agree to discuss issues/challenges that lead to homelessness and agree to focus on the implementation of solutions in the Housing Plan. Case Management may continue from 1 - 18 months until they reach self-reliance.   Open Door  This program is the same as Journey Home, but for individuals. Since 2012, MCREST assisted 53 individuals and/or families with moving into permanent housing through our supportive housing programs, Journey Home and Open Door. This aligns with the goal of providing rental assistance to help guests transition back into affordable housing as they secure income.   Learning and Resource Center  The Learning and Resource Center open in September to provide our guests assistance with the application for government benefits, job readiness training, and job placement services. The Center helps fill the critical gap of income from employment that remains the missing link between emergency shelter and supportive housing services. The Center will accomplish this by providing an innovative approach to job readiness training and job placement services specifically designed to assist the homeless with finding employment. This approach, coupled with applying for government benefits, will address all of the key barriers identified in their housing plan while providing a resource that is essential to a successful transition to self-sufficiency. The following describes the services that will be provided by the Center.   Application for Government Benefits  MCREST will provide access to our fifteen (12) computers in the Center for our guests to utilize the Michigan Department of Human Services MI Bridges website to apply for food assistance, cash assistance, child development and care, state emergency relief, and Medicaid health insurance. MCREST plans to also assist guests enroll in Medicaid through the Health Insurance Marketplace made available through the Affordable Care Act. Job Readiness Training: Our accessible Learning and Resource Center will provide the necessary job readiness assessments, employability skills training, interpersonal development (soft skills) that will lead to employment and affordable housing. The Learning and Resource Center Director designed the curriculum, conducts assessments, and provides instruction. The employability skills training and interpersonal development curriculum was designed specifically for the special needs of homeless individuals. Emphasis will include basic resume design and interviewing skills since many students have been unemployed or underemployed for months or even years. The Learning and Resource Center Director will focus on improving attitudes, building self-esteem, and creating the self-confidence that they can improve their quality of life and achieve beyond expectations. Intake to the emergency shelter will include job history and a financial analysis. If guests are unemployed or under employed they will be referred to the Center. Job Placement Services Once a student, completes the job readiness training, determines what career to pursue the Center will assist in developing a personalized job search plan. Each student will learn how to search for a job in the 21st century utilizing the power of the internet, networking, and other techniques. A MCREST success coach will guide a student through this difficult process."}]}], "address": "20415 Erin St.", "city": "Roseville", "county": "", "state": "MI", "zip": "48066", "phone": "(586) 415-5101", "web": "", "latitude": "", "longitude": "", "facebook": "", "type": "shelter", "short_info": ""}, "17525 East 10 Mile Road, Roseville, MI, USA": {"name": "Outstretched Arms", "description": [{"title": "Outstretched Arms", "description": "Assistance in housing; job searching; money management; and organizational skills."}], "address": "17525 E.

When temperatures rise above 90 degrees, the shelter becomes a cooling station to prevent heat related illnesses among transient populations.

The Hand-Up Lodge (HUL) is unique in its approach serving men, women, and children, when most other local shelters serve only men or only women and children. The Hand-Up Lodge Homeless Emergency Shelter provides short-term housing that provides a place for individuals and families to stay, eat and sleep. The Lynchburg Community Action Groups, Commerce Street facility is the main entry for homeless individuals in need of temporary housing. Lyn-CAG is a service-enriched non-profit agency, which offers a multitude of programs that provides many homeless individuals with assistance.     The Hand-Up Lodge utilizes the services of many community agencies to assist clients in dealing with barriers such as lack of transportation, chronic unemployment, mental health issues, medical concerns, and housing affordability. Families seeking shelter receive additional support for their children including healthcare, childcare, and ongoing education.     This 28-bed facility works with other area shelters. As soon as application approval is received, clients begin the process of recovery. First clients receive one-on-one crisis counseling. Second, the client devises an \"action plan\"  a detailed activity guide for the months ahead, with self-sufficiency as the main goal. This \"action plan\" helps the client to focus on the steps necessary to securing employment and permanent housing. Guests progress is monitored and they are encouraged to apply for The Housing Choice Voucher Program (formerly Section 8, the agencys Homeless Intervention Program (HIP) or Homelessness Prevention and Rapid-Re-housing Program (HPRP) or other subsidized housing programs.     Emergency Shelter Workers make contact with homeless individuals and families, serve as a resource for them, and make referrals to other systems. Working at all hours of the day, shelter workers provide appropriate support for the needy homeless applicant. Shelter workers assist individuals and families in familiarizing themselves with shelter settings and regulations. Typically, applicants go through a double process of being interviewed (intake), assessed for their basic needs, and overall goal. Shelter workers help guests to settle into the shelter environment, and oversee the day-to-day operations of the shelter, including enforcing shelter rules. Staff duties also include case management, coordination with other human service agencies who provide services and make referrals to service.     The Hand-Up Lodge has established collaborations with outside agencies that can assist families with children. Homelessness and inadequate housing often negatively affect children and families; therefore, direct referrals to Child Protective Services (CPS) has been highly effective. Guests are required to register with CPS receives structured and beneficial guidance in parenting, nutrition, safety, employment and personal care of self. Child Protective Services provide the emergency shelter with feedback and suggestions regarding referrals. This is a unique and successful partnering.     The HUL prides itself in being able to provide a safe environment for families. The recently installed security system, allows visual monitoring of inside and outside areas of the HUL. Security lighting in the most vulnerable outside areas surrounding the lodge gives guest s a feeling of security when parking their cars or entering the lodge. Guests with children are more at ease while living at the shelter, knowing that there is surveillance 24 hours a day. Our major focus is to keep the children safe.     Upon entry, each guest is given a personal care kit. This kit provides a guest with the necessary personal hygiene items to promote cleanliness. The lodge also provides a laundry facility for washing and drying of their clothes. The HUL does not prepare food for individuals, but we will furnish individuals and families with food as needed. In the women and childrens area, the HUL provides a playroom for younger children, and books, stuffed animals and puzzles for older children. A television will be added to this room for the children."}], "address": "915 Main Street", "city": "Lynchburg", "county": "", "state": "VA", "zip": "24504", "phone": "(434) 846-2778", "web": "", "latitude": "", "longitude": "", "facebook": "", "type": "shelter", "short_info": ""}, "626 Church St, Lynchburg, VA, USA": {"name": "YWCA of Central Virginia", "description": [{"title": "YWCA of Central Virginia", "description": "Safe, affordable housing for women 18 and older.

Working with volunteers that pick up the homeless, take them to one of our partner churches; our volunteers do many things. Some drive, some provide overnight supervision, others provide meals and some help with program administration and leadership. We provide a hot meal on most nights. We also provide cots and a warm, safe place to sleep for adult men and women. The sleep area depends on the church area we have available to us. Often we get to enjoy a movie! Each church commits to opening their doors for two seven day periods (14 nights) during the winter season, roughly November thru March. That's 20 weeks. Each week the shelter rotates to another church in Loveland. This ensures that no one church is burdened with too much responsibility and that many people get to experience helping at different churches during the winter.  Inclement Night Shelter activates the shelter only if bad weather is forecast ( Night time low 20 degrees or below ). So some churches that are on-call for their week may actually only be open for 3-4 nights during their scheduled week.

Common barriers that keep families from competing in the tight housing market in Colorado are: poor credit history, past evictions, lack of living-wage employment. These are areas that case managers, partnered with other agencies in the community, will help us address.  Children of school age are transported by the R2J School District to keep them in their current school whenever possible.  Adults are connected to vital resources, including but not limited to House of Neighborly Service and other partners within Life Center.

It is the only safe haven for single, homeless women in the Fresno County. It started in 2002 by a group of concerned community members who observed numerous homeless women on the streets of Fresno. Naomis House is a 24-bed overnight shelter for single, homeless women. It provides basic necessities such as showers, clothing, meals and medical and/or dental care.  Each woman is served with dignity and respect. Clients can participate in case management services to assist them in finding housing, accessing mental health services and assisting them in making positive life choices to achieve self-sufficiency. Classes provided are: Peer counseling, life skills, agency referrals, health education, 12-step class, 12-step support group and self-esteem class.  Naomis House is supported through a Housing and Urban Development Grant (HUD), however Poverello House provides a cash match, security and any additional funding the program may require.  Women wishing to access Naomis House services are through self or local agency referral. To access services your must be a homeless, single female, over 18 years old, and have the ability to care for yourself.  Women sign in nightly Monday through Friday at 4:30 p.m. and weekends and holidays at 12:45 p.m. There is no limit on nights of stay; a woman may access services as long as she chooses to do so.    Village of Hope   The Village of Hope was established in 2004 in response to the increased number of homeless encampments in the City of Fresno.  Helping a person end the cycle of homelessness is complicated and requires many different approaches. Many of the homeless population suffer from severe mental illness and substance abuse issues. Many homeless have experienced both physical and mental trauma from living on the streets. Some of them lack any form of identification and are in need of substance abuse treatment and mental health counseling. Often times, even though they desire a home, they are not in a position to maintain housing.  The Village provides a unique opportunity for the homeless to sleep off the streets and live in a community-type environment. The structures they live in are simple \"Tuff Shed\"-like shelters. While in the Village there are is three simple rules, \"take care of yourself, take care of others, and take care of this place.\" The residents provide their own security and clean-up crew. Clients are not allowed to possess alcohol or drugs while living in the Village. The Client Services Coordinator, who oversees the Village, provides the occupants access to education, life-skill training, substance abuse counseling and mental health referrals. The shelter provided by Poverello House is the bridge between homelessness and housing that our clients need to be successful in securing permanent housing. The Village of Hope is open Monday - Friday from 4 p.m. - 7 a.m. and weekends and holidays from noon - 9 a.m.   Clothing, Showers and Laundry   CLOTHING is distributed every Tuesday from 1  2 p.m. ID is required to receive clothing.

Emergency Shelter   BHS provides a sanctuary for desperate homeless families in need of help to achieve stable housing and income. Our shelters meet each familys immediate needs for safety, housing, food and other necessities. While in shelter, parents receive the resources and information needed to help them obtain a living income, organize a comfortable home, and provide a nurturing environment for their children. Perhaps most important, parents themselves feel cared for and realize that they will develop a realistic plan for a better future for themselves and their children while they are guests of BHS.                                               Housing                                   Rapid Re-Housing programs, considered by the Department of Housing  Urban Development (HUD) to be the best housing practice for alleviating homelessness, provides financial assistance and supportive services to families experiencing homelessness. The goal of the program is to expedite housing and stabilization of the family as quickly as possible. It is easier and more efficient for families to sign up for benefits or apply for jobs when they have the stability that a home provides. They are also less stressed and better organized at home than when in shelter.  The program provides several forms of assistance, including: identification of affordable housing suitable for the familys needs; short-term or medium-term rental assistance and housing relocation and stabilization services, including such activities as mediation, credit counseling, security or utility deposits, utility payments, moving cost assistance, and case management. Housing case managers and a housing specialist assist each family to develop a housing plan, serve as liaison between family and landlord, and manage complex issues such as lease options, contracts and apartment inspections.     Shelter Diversion  Shelter diversion programs are identified by the National Alliance to End Homelessness as best practice for prevention of homelessness for families seeking to enter a shelter. This strategy avoids the trauma of homelessness for families by helping them to identify immediate alternative housing arrangements while connecting them with the services and financial resources needed to achieve permanent housing. The case manager guides the family through the process of developing a comprehensive, reality-based plan for ensuring a secure future in stable housing. This program conserves shelter beds and assistance for those who truly have no resources of their own and no options other than a homeless shelter or the streets."}], "address": "1841 Fairmount Avenue", "city": "Cincinnati", "county": "", "state": "OH", "zip": "45214", "phone": "(513) 381-7233", "web": "", "latitude": "", "longitude": "", "facebook": "", "type": "shelter", "short_info": ""}, "1805 Dalton Avenue, Cincinnati, OH, USA": {"name": "City Gospel Mission", "description": [{"title": "City Gospel Mission", "description": "City Gospel Mission empowers homeless and hurting men and women and at-risk youth to break the cycle of poverty and despair.

Family  Single Womens Program  The Family Shelter Program for women and their children provides case management, independent living skills training, parenting education, counseling, linkages to medical care, child care, and transportation. Over 50% of those entering the shelter are survivors of domestic violence. Ten families can be sheltered at a time. Approximately 25  30 families, including over 60 children and 47 single women are served each year.   Single Mens Program  Homeless Solutions is able to provide shelter for as many as 25 homeless men at one time with about 100 men served annually. The Mens Shelter Program provides case management services; money management training, and assists with benefits enrollment and placement in permanent housing. This Program serves about 115 men each year.  Safe Haven Program  The Safe Haven Shelter Program, in partnership with the Mental Health Association, provides shelter and services for homeless people with a mental health diagnosis. This is the only program of its kind in the state, and we can house up to 20 men and women, providing case management and outreach services. Annually, Safe Haven shelters 50  60 individuals.  Transitional Housing Program (THP)  Homeless Solutions Transitional Housing Program offers support and training to families who are making the move to independence. In order to eradicate the underlying issues associated with recurring homelessness, structured supervision is provided to foster self-sufficiency. The participants are housed in ten self-contained apartments.   Family Supportive Housing Program (Outreach)  When participants move out of THP, they are given the opportunity to enroll in HSIs Family Supportive Housing Program, also known as Outreach. This Program provides follow up case management services for two-years following their exit. These families can continue to attend educational workshops and participate in the seasonal item distributions. The goal of this program is to ensure that they remain housed and do not cycle back into homelessness.  The Mt. Kemble Home in Morristown was founded in 1883 to provide affordable housing for senior women of limited means The Home is listed on national and state historic registers, in part due to its unique, purpose-built social mission. Unfortunately, due to mounting financial pressures and other organizational challenges, it was in danger of having to close.  The HSI Board and staff knew that if this happened, the 19 residents there would struggle to find safe, decent housing so we worked with the Board of The Mt. Kemble Home and decided that the best outcome would be for HSI to take over The Mount Kemble Home.  Effective May 1, 2013, The Mt. Kemble Home moved under the HSI umbrella, and we are happy to be able to include The Home as one of our programs providing shelter, housing, and supportive services to low-income people. We hosted a ribbon cutting in January of 2017 on our completed extensive, multi-phased renovation.

We believe that every man deserves dignity and refuge as they attempt to put their lives back together. The homeless situation is a tragic one. It is often a result of the all to common occurrence of people losing both their homes and their jobs at the same time, and is not a reflection of character but rather the result of ill-timed and unfortunate circumstances. We know that the homeless condition can happen to anyone.  2. Men's Addiction Recovery - The Providence Ministries Christian Drug and Alcohol Recovery Program for men has been redeeming lives and saving souls in the name of Jesus Christ, since 1985. Our time-tested, long-term 6 month faith based rehab alternative to traditional drug and alcohol rehabilitation treatment has helped people from all across the nation, is extremely value packed, and extremely effective.   3. Women's Addiction Recovery - Drug rehab, Alcohol rehab. We are more then a recovery center, we are a spiritual regeneration program, and our goal is to help women completely transform their lives. website: http://providencewomensrecovery.com/  4. Homeless Women's and Children's Shelter - This mission's purpose is to offer a temporary place of refuge for homeless women and their children while the mother addresses the economic, social, and spiritual issues that led to their homelessness. It is designed to give homeless women an opportunity to take a hard look at themselves, and to take the necessary steps to move out of the bondage of homelessness.  The program can house a total of 12 persons, that being any combination of women and children. The prerequisites for approval into the shelter are that the mother be homeless, not suffering from a physical or mental disability (as we are not medically staffed but can refer), and not be in danger or dealing with a domestic dispute or battered woman situation (again, we can refer).  We offer one-on-one counseling, complimentary meals for the mother and children, and a fully furnished living area separated from any of the men's facilities. That said, their are some requirements. First, we require that the mother be ardently looking for work during the day. Second, we require that the women remain free of drugs and alcohol, and third, we require that the family attend church on Wednesdays, and twice on Sunday's.  We have gone to great lengths to create a safe, second-to-none shelter. The opportunity for women to grow and heal with us here at Providence is very real and very attainable. And as long as the women staying here are putting in the effort, we will stand behind them and assist them in any way we can. For more information or if you have questions, please call the women's intake coordinator at (706)275-0268.  5. Free Meals.

SHALOM came into existence to offer food  lodging to the homeless of Middletown at a time when it was feared that the city's only homeless shelter would close.   SHALOM is an acronym for Serving the Homeless with Alternate Lodging Of Middletown.   Now entering its sixth year of ministry SHALOM has become a network of local churches of various denominations that\"share their bread with the hungry, and bring the homeless poor into their houses\". (Isaiah 58:7)  Each week on a rotating basis, a church in the network provides meals and shelter within their church facilities.   A van has been purchased to transport those in need of shelter from a central location to the host church.   Guests have an opportunity to shower before dinner, and to relax after dinner in a safe warm environment.   Though participating churches have different traditions, worship styles, outreach programs and ministries, they have found common ground in enthusiastically serving the less fortunate and homeless of the community through this shared ministry.   It is estimated that 300 church members and concerned citizens participate or contribute resources to make this ministry work.   When a new person comes to SHALOM for shelter, a written list of policies is provided so that each guest knows what to expect, and what is expected from them.   Each person receives a supply of personal care items and a container for their personal items.  Social workers meet weekly to interview and advise each guest on how to apply for assistance that might empower them to become self-sufficient.   This assistance may be in the form of medical care, food stamps, clothing, employment or housing.   Some guests may require all of these areas, while others may need only a little encouragement and help to overcome their situations.

Each guest family will work with their case manager to create a plan of action, outlining goals, achievements and timelines. Follow-up support is provided through our Family Mentoring Program.   Home Furnishings:  Family Promise of Shawnee receives community donations of furniture, appliances and some household items. In return, those donations are stored at the day center and given to families that need home furnishings once they obtain permanent housing.   Educational Programs:  Family Promise of Shawnee continues to utilize an array of support services to help guest families address issues in: finance, parenting, self-esteem, continuing education, nutrition, etc. Every family in our program is required to complete a money management program, other educational programs are optional.   Family Mentoring Program:  Once families obtain permanent housing they are offered the opportunity to participate in the Family Mentoring Program. Our volunteer mentors receive 6 hours of training and assist their assigned families in maintaining their independence in the community.     Just Neighbors Curriculum:  Participants obtain a deep understanding and awareness of the reality of poverty and the   working poor, Congregations, Bible study groups, nonprofit organizations, schools, etc. can use this curriculum to change attitudes, recruit volunteers, and empower advocates for our neighbors in need.  Volunteer Training and Support: Volunteers are the foundation of Family Promise of Shawnee. Through their congregations, approximately 500 volunteers provide homeless families with the basic human needs of shelter, safety and sustenance, with a spirit of warmth and hospitality. Each congregation has a volunteer coordinator (or team) to recruit volunteers within their congregations and organize the project. Family Promise of Shawnee provides training and support for the coordinators and volunteers.  Need for Shelter: Being without a safe, warm place to sleep, eat, and care for children; being without the security of familiar people and things - this is homelessness. Family Promise of Shawnee was the first Family Promise program in the state of Oklahoma. Family Promise of Shawnee is funded through contributions from congregations, individuals, grants, special events, and United Way.

Volunteers prepare meals, provide supplies, host evening activities, sleep overnight, staff the day center, and most importantly provide human compassion.  A Network van is available to transport guests between host congregations and the day center; children are transported to their schools of origin, providing for continuity in their education during a time of instability.  The Guest Guidelines call for a maximum stay of 30 days. However, Network Directors often extend the stay as long as the family is making good-faith efforts to secure housing. For this reason families typically stay for 60 days or more.  There is no cost to join the Network. The cost for hosting is about $200 per year, based on minor supply needs.

Permanent Housing  The Permanent Housing Program (PHP) is a one year commitment to living in an apartment with a roommate and working ones way to self-sufficiency. Adults have to be chronically homeless or disabled to qualify. A person is considered chronically homeless when he/she has experienced at least two episodes of homelessness in the past year of at least 30 days duration each. A person is considered permanently disabled if he/she is receiving benefits from the Social Security Administration. Since program inception, nearly 100 Community Shelter residents have transitioned into UCMs Permanent Housing Program, of which 85% remain permanently housed today.   Rapid Re-housing  UCMs Rapid Re-Housing is a successful community strategy for ending homelessness. The intent is to minimize the length of time an individual or family remains in the limbo of homelessness and to help the household quickly re-establish stability. In the safety and predictability of permanent housing, they are encouraged to choose how, when and where they will address other life problems or goals using mainstream resources. Rapid Re-Housing resolves the crisis of homelessness; the rest is up to the individual or familyand their community support systems. Rapid Re-Housing can provide financial assistance in the form of security/utility deposits, rent/utility payments, rent/utility arrears, and application fees. All assistance is based on individual assessment and case plan.

In the most recent year, the program provided emergency shelter solution to 64 families in crisis while guiding 84% of families toward achieving self-sufficiency. Project SAFEProject SAFE, Adopt-A-Family's longest running housing program, provides a safe, consistent, and nurturing environment for 32 families experiencing homelessness. The program targets the community's most vulnerable families and prioritizes those with a head of household living with a disability. Each resident of Project SAFE receives support from an on-site case manager. This includes providing families with access to financial literacy training, educational opportunities, mental health referrals, life-skills training, and affordable childcare. The program works collaboratively with service providers from the community to enhance opportunities for the families we serve. Some of these agencies include Dress for Success, Palm Beach State College, Genesis Community Health, The Lord's Place, Community Partners, and other members of Palm Beach County's Housing and Homeless Alliance. Program facts: Project SAFE was a recipient of a unique grant award through the Community Foundation for Palm Beach and Martin Counties. The grant provided funding for the installation of state-of-the-art, impact windows for all five buildings in the program. The upgrade allows for a safer and more energy efficient environment in Project SAFE.  Due to the barriers faced by the population the program serves, the program expanded its on-site staffing by bringing on an on-site therapist through a generous private foundation grant.
