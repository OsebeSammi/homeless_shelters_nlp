This flagship program serves roughly 60 male and female veterans annually in houses throughout South and Southeast Austin.  Green Doors' scattered site model was developed in response to the specific needs of the homeless veterans it serves. In order to enroll in the program an individual must have reached the point in his/her transition from homelessness that he/she is ready and committed to achieving independent living. The scattered sites mimic living arrangements after program exit, and offer veteran residents the opportunity to assimilate and adopt many of the life skills necessary to successfully transition, including money management, being good neighbors, and obtaining income through sustained employment.  Residents pay a rent of no more than 30% of their adjusted monthly income. These single-family homes, which residents share as roommates, are embedded in Austin's middle-class neighborhoods. Houses and yards are well maintained and blend unobtrusively in their respective neighborhoods. All homes are fully furnished and contain a washer and dryer, making laundry easy for all residents. The organization also provides residents with a weekly food pantry, a computer with Internet access, household necessities and telephone service with individual voice mailboxes.  Green Doors also coordinates supportive services through a partnership with the Veterans Administration. Intensive case management services ensure veterans are pursuing a path towards self-sufficiency. Case management services include: outreach, creating and maintaining a service plan, referral to counseling, job and life skills training, and continuing education. Through the case management process, residents can access classes designed to improve independent living skills, including job readiness, life skills, money management, conflict resolution and decision-making. Community resources are utilized for job training, continuing education, and support groups. Additional supportive services provided to residents through case management include financial assistance with rent, utilities, clothing, food, glasses and medical prescriptions. All efforts are geared toward moving veterans out of homelessness and on to independent living within our community.  Participants in the Transitional Veterans Re-Entry Housing program typically earn 0-30% of Austin's median family income. To be eligible for the program a potential resident must provide military documentation and demonstrate an active desire to return to independent living.  If you are interested in learning more about the program please feel free to contact us. ",  "url":"https://www.shelterlistings.org/details/36744"}
