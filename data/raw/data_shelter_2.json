It  is generally longer than two weeks but typically 60 days or more and,  in many cases, up to two years or more. The supportive services may be  provided directly by the organization managing the housing or may be  coordinated by them and provided by other public or private agencies.

In  some cases, a transition in place option allows families to continue  living in the same complex (if not the same unit) where their  transitional housing unit is located when they are ready to move to  permanent housing. In other cases, the permanent housing option is  either public housing or private rental housing supported by a  tenant-based voucher subsidy.

We assist female ex-offenders from all ethnic backgrounds that are re-entering society after incarceration in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice system and have demonstrated a willingness to make positive changes in their life. These women are dealing with the residual pain of having been separated from their children for a long period of time and do not have the immediate financial resources to sustain their family. Exodus helps them and their families to become productive members of society by serving their spiritual and physical needs. Ex-offenders face many life issues and the stigma of being in prison. Most have struggled with substance abuse and have been abandoned by their husbands. Without loving care and structured guidance, they are vulnerable to returning to their self-defeating ways and negatively impacting the future of their children. It is typical for an inmate leaving prison to arrive in Dallas with only $50, no job, just a few friends, and with little hope. Old criminal habits are just waiting in the shadows. While the average worker makes several thousand decisions a day; an inmate makes less than a hundred a day. This is because everything in prison is regimented. So when they touch ground in the free world, they are overwhelmed with responsibility, yet void of training, a support system, or a spirit-centered life. Most are destined to fail. \r Mandatory classes are held 5 days each week.&nbsp; One of those classes is Celebrate Recovery.&nbsp; Other classes include weekly parenting classes, Bible study, money management and budgeting, and other classes offered for the enrichment of the experience such as sewing, flower arranging, self-defense, and similar topics.

The goal for each guest is to identify the issue(s) that have created the state of homelessness and begin to address those issues, so they can transition into a long-term solution.  Provided they&rsquo;re not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, walk-in guests are offered a bed, along with showers, food, clothing, counseling, care and spiritual support.  The Mission provides 175 (sometimes more) beds for homeless men, women and children each night.  Shelter use is not an answer to homelessness, but a first step to self-sufficiency.  Our guests are encouraged to join the Mission&rsquo;s long-term recovery programs to get to the root causes of their homelessness so they can end it permanently.

While at The Life Center, they will receive the services listed and also be referred to other agencies, ones that can assist them with getting proper identification, also agencies that help with employment, in an effort to give them opportunity to escape the cycle of life on the streets.   The Life Center Vision began in 1989 and is a 501c3 non-profit, faith based Christian Organization. Located on Old Yale St., close to the Independence Heights area of Houston and the historical Acres Homes, we are ideally positioned to make a difference.   Our present facilities include three living areas and a separate Multi &ndash; purpose Facility that can be used for educational classes, meetings and motivational sessions, and Chapel with the ability to support our community and make a visible difference.  We have six buildings on our new Campus. We have a total of 10 facilities and room to grow.   The Life Center operates as a 24&ndash;hour refuge for those who are in need. There is also a 90-day Rehabilitation Program.   There is an on-site Director and an outreach team. We have a non-discrimination policy. Shelter and Spiritual Guidance are our first priority. Shelter bed space will be divided up according to two areas of importance. First, priority will be given to clients who have decided to fully participate in the program according to its rules and expectations. These people will be allowed to remain residents for a targeted stay of no more than ninety days. The other area of importance is people who need temporary shelter. These persons will be asked to join the program or find another shelter. The Center will be operated under a set of rules to be established from time to time by the Board of Directors or The Director of The Life Center with the help of an Advisory Board made up of the Director and selected Residents of The Life Center. These rules must be followed for continued participation in the program. It is the intent of this program to provide safe, clean and beneficial shelter to individuals in need. The Center will be monitored on a twenty-four hour basis by the Center Staff, including but not limited to the Director and Assistant Director. Our second major objective is to provide our residents with three meals a day. In addition, we hope to provide meals to homeless nonresidents, if possible. Implementation of a training and development program is the next major objective. As a part of development programs, weekly training sessions will be conducted which will focus in on such things as assisting with securing their proper identification, driver's licenses, social security cards, bank accounts, budgeting, grocery shopping, nutrition, job search skills, resume' writing, interview skills, locations of affordable housing and referrals to other agencies that can assist with other needs. The Life Center's mission is to provide services and Christian support to persons who, by the power of The Holy Spirit, choose to turn their lives around. When the person decides to turn away from their former life, The Life Center begins providing programs, various services and assistance that address the physical needs as well as the Spiritual needs. The cornerstone of our mission is to reach the Homeless by going to the streets three times a week (rain or shine!), with the sole intent of bringing someone back to The Life Center. Thanks to the talents of Pastor Winston James, we always bring someone back! Seeing The Life Center's Dorms filled uplifts our hearts, yet tells us, this is the easy part. The next step is to assist a person in turning their lives around in 90 days or less. That is our goal. We are joyous when we receive an opportunity to help someone who has chosen to work our program. Thus far, 6 out of every 10 people that come through our doors achieve the goal! Although 6 out of every 10 people meet this goal, we still have more work, for instance, for those who didn't complete our program, we pray for the opportunity to work with them at a later date, and in most cases, they do return. We will keep their names in our database, and continue to pray for them. We also keep in touch with those who have graduated.

Seeing a lone rose amongst a sea of weeds and thorns in her late grandmother&rsquo;s abandoned garden sparked Michele&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp;Seeing this beautiful creation thrive in the midst of the heat, turmoil, and lack of attention from a gardener stirred her&nbsp;spirit. God spoke directly to Michele while in deep prayer and gave her a vision,&nbsp;thus&nbsp;calling this ministry into existence.   She Arose Ministries, Inc. is a Christ centered transitional home for homeless women who are searching for answers to life&rsquo;s hardest questions. These women have no family or place to go. Whether recovering from a divorce, escaping an abusive environment, or living on the street, we provide a safe and inviting place to live away from distractions. These women will be discipled in God&rsquo;s word as they learn to rebuild their lives to go back into the world and serve their communities.  The women have a paid house mom and live together. They are responsible for the upkeep of the home, garden, and property. They cook their own meals with donations and the food stamps allotted to them. Regular church attendance and Bible studies geared at repairing their lives through Christ&rsquo;s love and forgiveness are mandatory and crucial for success. The women eventually obtain a job and have an opportunity to pay for their stay giving them a means to a good foundation to begin their lives again. &nbsp; We, as Christians, have been called to serve and be the hands and feet of Jesus. We believe whole-heartedly that God has called us to this mission. We are fully accountable and open with our finances in a way that will honor and give all glory to God.

On any given night, there are over 250 individuals in the Greater Texarkana Community who are homeless. The Randy Sams' Outreach Shelter serves to eradicate the cycle of homelessness. The RSOS services individuals who are homeless or at risk of homelessness such as men, women, the hungry, the low-income, veterans, and those who are unemployed and underemployed. Emergency Shelter  The RSOS is a 90-day shelter that provides basic essential activities of daily living such as meals, seperate sleeping areas for men and women, and bathrooms which include shower facilities for residential clients. Each day breakfast is served at 6:00am and dinner is served at 6:00pm. Clients are encouraged to have lunch across the street at the Friendship Center from 11:00am-1:00pm. Clients leave during the day at 7:00am and can return for check-in at 3:30pm. All new clients must have some form of identification when applying for residency. A complete list of Rules will be reviewed during admission. Case Management  Upon intake and admission, all residential clients a enrolled in the Case Management Program. This program allows clients to have an initial meeting with the Residential Services Case Manager who will work with the client in identifying needs as well as assist in linking residents to mainstream community resources. When discharging from the program, clients will meet with the Housing Resource Case Manager who will assist the client in locating permenant housing and prevent re-entry into homelessness. Identity Document Assistance  Residents who do not have the basic information such as a picture i.d., may qualify for identity documentation assistance. We believe that the first step towards becoming self-sufficient is through establishment of identity. Items such as birth certificates and state issued identification are necessary in order to obtain employment. Medical Assistance  If needed, the RSOS assists residential clients with life-sustaining essential prescriptions. The RSOS believes that the high cost of prescription medications for those without insurance, indirectly contributes to the recidivism rate of homelessness. In order to allow residents to focus on saving funds for housing, the RSOS alleviates the burden of high prescription costs.

Services include: emergency services and shelter, basic necessities (clothing, hygiene items, etc.), case management supportive services, such as mental health services, connection to substance abuse providers, housing programs, employment services, after school programs, pre-school programs, art therapy, housing stability services, and basic life skills. We strive to provide as many services on-site at the shelter as possible, so these services are easily accessible to the people we serve.  Shelter Shelter is often the first step on the road home.  The Road Home operates low barrier shelter with housing focused services for men, women and families in Salt Lake County, Utah.  Our Emergency Shelters, the Salt Lake Community Shelter and the Midvale Center, are open 365 days a year, including holidays to help meet the needs of single men, single women, and families in our community. While some nights the shelter has more people staying with us than others, we make every attempt to provide shelter to everyone who is in need of a place to stay.   Along with providing life-saving emergency shelter, we help people re-build their support networks and create stability in their lives through our housing programs, case management, and connecting them with community partners.  &nbsp; Shelter Locations Salt Lake Community Shelter and Resource Center  210 South Rio Grande Street Salt Lake City, UT 84101 801-359-4142 info@theroadhome.org    &nbsp;Midvale Center  529 West 7300 South (9th Ave.) Midvale, UT 801-569-1201 info@theroadhome.org &nbsp;Serving families with children.&nbsp; Our Midvale Center is open year-round. &nbsp; &nbsp;Housing Programs  The Road Home delivers housing services to households using Progressive Engagement within Housing First. Progressive Engagement is the practice of helping households end their homelessness as rapidly as possible, despite barriers, with minimal financial and support resources; more supports are applied to those households who struggle to stabilize in housing. Rapid Rehousing is considered a light-touch intervention, while Permanent Supportive Housing is reserved for the most vulnerable households. Housing First prioritizes helping people experiencing homelessness locate and move in to housing, then providing individualized and voluntary supportive services as needed. This approach emphasizes participant choice in both housing selection and in service participation.   &nbsp;  Rapid Rehousing Program for Families  Approximately 50% of families we serve use emergency shelter services for a very short period and do not return to shelter. Every family staying in our housing-focused shelter is assisted in creating a Housing Plan, which includes a targeted housing date. Support to meet this housing date includes: creation of a housing plan, housing location assistance, employment and benefit assistance through Department of Workforce Services and housing placement case management supports. Families that are unable to resolve their homelessness without financial support may be prioritized for Rapid Re-housing (RRH) financial assistance. Once in housing, families receive case management supports focused on stabilizing in housing. Each month of the program, Case Managers assess families for housing stability and connect households to supports that will bolster that stability. If families need assistance to stabilize beyond an initial small package of assistance, we may extend our support from month to month. An extension of support is determined by whether or not the family will become homeless the following month without our assistance. We expect that every family will be successful with RRH supports. Since 2009 we have served over 3,000 households with the Rapid Rehousing and Progressive Engagement model.   Eligibility: Families experiencing literal homeless (living in an emergency shelter, the streets or a location uninhabitable by people).    Supportive Services for Veteran Families (Rapid Rehousing for Veterans)  In 2012, The Road Home was awarded a Supportive Services for Veteran Families grant. Since then, our grant award doubled, and we have worked in a community collaboration to end homelessness for all Veterans. RRH packages are offered to individuals and families with heads of households that have Veteran status. As with RRH for families, all Veteran households are offered the same package of assistance: barrier debt elimination, a deposit, pro-rate, up to nine months of rental assistance and case management. As part of a community wide partnership including outreach agencies, other shelter providers, public housing authorities and resources from Department of Veteran Affairs, we know we will realize our goal to eliminate homelessness for Veterans.  Eligibility: Veterans, and their families, that are literally homeless.   Click here to see the infographic from the National Alliance to End Homelessness about why the Supportive Services for Veteran Families program is important.  &nbsp;  Housing Not Jail; Pay For Success  Housing Not Jail is a new Pay for Success model program aimed at serving single adults that are persistently homeless (90-364 days of homelessness). The program launched in January 2017 and will conclude in 2022. Housing Not Jail is the first randomized control trial for Rapid Rehousing for individuals experiencing persistent homelessness in the world. The data produced by the project will inform housing models and programs everywhere. Individuals who meet the persistently homeless criteria are randomly selected to participate in the program and receive a Rapid Rehousing package of support: barrier debt elimination, security deposit and three to nine months of rental assistance and case management. This program has unique enhancements, such as behavioral health services and employment support, and is addressing a long-standing need in our community to assist individuals that do not have a history of chronic homelessness.   Eligibility: Single men and women that are literally homeless and have a history of persistent homelessness. Referrals are not accepted for this program. ", "address": "210 S.

VOAC works closely to engage homeless households on finding the right, most affordable housing options. VOAC has worked closely with Arlington County and partner agencies to establish the unified shelter standards, taking part in the 1010 line, and is the lead agency for Prevention and Diversion programs. VOAC offers case management services to all clients and assists with developing an individualized plan to address financial stability, increasing employment, assessing for housing type, and assists with how clients can remain permanently housed. \r &nbsp; \r Facility Description&nbsp; \r RPC is located in Arlington County at 1554 Columbia Pike conveniently located off of 395 near the Air Force Memorial and the Pentagon. \r &nbsp; \r Persons Served&nbsp; \r RPC services are targeted towards adults experiencing homelessness for the Emergency Shelter or for households at-risk of experiencing homelessness for the Diversion/Prevention Services. Early Recovery and Non-Medical Detoxification services are designed to assist individuals suffering from addiction who desire a clean, safe, and healing environment to overcome the hold of substance abuse. \r &nbsp; \r Services Provided&nbsp; \r RPC is designed to provide supportive services to help each participant to increase and develop self-sufficiency in multiple areas such as housing, substance abuse, and mental health. Comprehensive case management is of primary importance and a case manager is assigned to each participant and is responsible for providing a comprehensive assessment of needs, ongoing support and coaching, as well as the formulation, implementation and management of an individualized service plans. Case management efforts are collaborative and client-focused in nature to ensure empowerment of the vulnerable populations we serve. \r &nbsp; \r Housing/Shelter Services&nbsp; \r The VOAC homeless services team is highly specialized, and assesses each client in the shelter and housing services programs on an ongoing basis. Each review assesses the services needed by each individual that will help ensure that they are positioned to not only obtain but also maintain permanent housing. In FY16, VOAC shifted its approach to service delivery to move from a traditional case management approach to a Housing Counselor Certifications and Program. Housing Counseling is offered to all households and increases the focus of obtaining and maintaining housing. As a complement to the programming provided, VOAC Housing Counselors work in partnership with the local community to link persons with access to primary care, oral health care, employment, training or educational activities, transportation programs and other resources uniquely required by each household served. A key piece of the initial client assessment is to identify the mainstream resources already being accessed by individuals while also assisting clients in accessing those services for which they may be eligible but are not currently receiving, such as Social Security Disability Insurance, Medicaid, Food Stamps, etc. \r &nbsp; \r Another critical component of the team is a community case manager (CCM) position which work in the shelter and in the community once an individual finds housing. The purpose of the CCM is to provide case management to those who have moved into permanent housing, with the goal of maintaining a safe, stable environment. Assistance with employment, community resources, financial literacy, and life skills are offered to clients as they make the transition from homeless to being a renter. This position is critical during a client's adjustment into the community and continues with the goals on the Housing Stabilization Plan. The support and resources that are offered to clients during their first three months of housing can set the course for them to success and maintain a permanent home. \r &nbsp; \r Substance Abuse Services&nbsp; \r The RPC substance abuse unit consists of two programs including Detox and Early Recovery. The Detox Unit accepts clients with any alcohol and/or substance abuse problem, as the focus of treatment is alcohol and substance abuse education and support from peers and highly trained counseling staff. The Detox Unit accepts clients 24 hours a day, and clients can stay up to 14 days (with 10 days being the average length of stay). Clients normally complete a pre-screening, but walk-ins are accepted if space is available. \r &nbsp; \r The Detox Unit is not a medical facility. The program uses the social model concept to assist clients in managing their detoxing process. As such, the criteria for admission requires a blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) less than .33 or a positive urinalysis screen. \r &nbsp; \r The alcohol and substance abuse program uses best practices as follows: \r Motivational Interviewing &ndash; an approach to help clients meet their stated needs; \r Co-occurring Capability &ndash; working with clients who have both alcohol and substance abuse and mental health issues; \r Stages of Change model, \r Self Help Group Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous; \r Acudetox Protocol &ndash; an acupuncture treatment therapy considered a best practices model in detox services. \r Peer Specialist Program with Arlington County Peer Group \r The focus of the Early Recovery Unit is to help clients embrace the beginnings of sober living by providing intensive residential treatment for a minimum of 90 days. Early Recovery clients participate in structured activities, family individual and group counseling, education and therapeutic support. In addition to the sober living concept, the clients are required to either obtain a job or an educational/ learning program while in treatment. All referrals for this program come via Arlington County Substance Abuse Services.

Buoyed by a vision of a community where everyone has a safe, decent and affordable home, our founders committed to the concept of a Service Enriched Housing Continuum that supports families on their journeys to real independence. By helping vulnerable families address the social and personal issues that may have contributed to their housing issues, cycles of poverty and hopelessness end. &nbsp; Housing Hope&rsquo;s programs offer a full range of housing types&mdash;emergency shelter, transitional housing and affordable rental apartments, as well as homeownership opportunities for low-income households. The Continuum is an effective and efficient method of helping families break the cycle of poverty. It recognizes that a family must have the basic need for safe shelter met before they can deal with other significant challenges. Conversely, providing only housing to people is not enough to significantly improve their chances for becoming successful members of the community. Only the combination of housing and supportive services gives these families the opportunity to become self-sufficient by building skills and resources for a better future.

This program offers a wraparound approach, an intervention strategy designed to address each homeless veteran&rsquo;s individual needs by &ldquo;wrapping&rdquo; a comprehensive array of services &ldquo;around&rdquo; the veteran based on his/her individual needs. Case management services include coordination of health benefits, claims assistance, criminal justice intervention, school enrollment, and enrollment in financial assistance as needed. Employment assistance, recovery support, and efforts toward stability and independent living are key to success. Veterans who do not have transportation are transported to employment and medical appointments. Recreation opportunities are provided and taught as an essential independent living and recovery skill set.  Residents who are interested in substance abuse and/or mental health recovery support can participate in individual and group services with a CADC and/or LCPC on staff. The program hosts a community AA group once per week on site and veterans from the community may attend.&nbsp; Veterans are encouraged to participate in faith-based communities of their choice within the community.  Once a resident is ready to reintegrate back into the community, aftercare support begins so that he/she becomes familiar with the resources of the community. If a veteran wishes, aftercare support can continue for up to two years via weekly or monthly contact with the aftercare case manager to help address any challenges that may arise.&nbsp; The site maintains a food pantry that can be accessed during or after residency at New Horizons. The program maintains a welcoming attitude to visitors, some of whom may be local veterans seeking short-term support and volunteers seeking to contribute to the program.

Transformation House breaks the trajectory by providing men with affordable housing while nurturing their spiritual, personal, educational and social development. Here&rsquo;s why we are a critical non-profit organization: &nbsp; A focus on developing the whole person We provide much more than a bed and a hot meal. Residents receive life skill classes, counseling, job search assistance, special seminars, financial guidance and linkage to churches and social services. In turn, men staying at the facility must hold a job or be actively searching, and maintain total drug and alcohol abstinence. Only men who are totally committed to changing their lives are admitted and allowed to stay with the program. Our primary purpose is to empower men to regain their independence. &nbsp; Founded by a man who walks the walk Pastor Manuelus Reacco knows firsthand the challenges and hardships facing men who have lost all hope. Spiritual and social guidance turned his life around, and now he works tirelessly helping others. Pastor Reacco has given his all, spiritually and financially to get this ambitious and worthwhile program off the ground. To grow and prosper, Transformation House needs others to provide support to ensure the program&rsquo;s long-term success. &nbsp; 100% of all donations go directly to work You can be assured that any monetary or material donation to Transformation House will go to changing lives. If you can provide cash, consumer products, building materials or professional services, we promise to put them to good use. When you meet the people involved with Transformation House, it will be clear that we are in the business of helping others. &nbsp; Multi-faceted community outreach support In addition to being a 30-bed housing facility, the building also houses a soup kitchen, food pantry and a drug and alcohol abuse recovery service.

Four agencies comprise this consortium.  EHAF is a rent subsidy for those persons who have a documented crisis.&nbsp; For example a medical emergency temporarily causing loss of hours at work, or an extenuating circumstance causing discretionary income to be utilized for the situation.&nbsp; EHAF is not for a security deposit and/or first and last month's rent.&nbsp; This isn't a fund to help someone move out of their current housing situation. It is for crisis situations.  In addition, Emergency Housing Assistance is available at our North Central CAP offices in Wood and Lincoln Counties.  Eligibility for EHAF includes: Must be a resident of the County utilizing the funds Individuals and families have three or more barriers to housing stability as identified in the initial assessment Individuals and families must have an income source to be eligible for rental assistance. An income source allows for ongoing rent payments to be made by the client after assistance has been provided.&nbsp; An income may be SSI or SSDI.  Clients agree to pay their portion of rent and must provide documentation of payment in the rental assistance program. Individuals and families are threatened with an eviction notice or other housing challenges to be eligible for emergency rental assistance Individuals and families must be willing to provide required documentation and cooperate with follow-up appointments with their case managers and outreach workers Landlords must be willing to work with the clients and guarantee 30 days of additional housing to the client once EHAF assistance is provided Individuals and families agree to participate in program follow-up conducted by United Way&rsquo;s 2-1-1 for emergency rental assistance &nbsp;  Housing and Homeless Prevention Homelessness Prevention is funding and programming for low-income individuals and households who are imminently at risk of becoming homeless.  North Central Community Action Program Housing First Programs include: Rapid Re-Housing  What are &lsquo;Housing First&rsquo; assistance programs for the homeless? North Central Community Action partners with the federal and state government on offering the Housing First program in Wood, Marathon, and Lincoln counties. This program will try to help the mid to long term homeless find an affordable home (apartment) to live in. The program helps with paying expenses, including offering rent subsidies and providing long term case management for support services.  This program differs from many other services as the client is first placed into a safe and affordable apartment. It attempts to completely bypass a shelter or other short term, transitional home. This means providing shelter is even more important than creating self-sufficiency.  Only after placement will the individual be asked to participate in other services, such as counseling, enrollment into substance abuse treatment or job training. The approach implemented by Housing First is just that; find a place for the person/family to live and then address other needs. Once a family has a permanent residence to come home to every day, many studies show that it is then easier to achieve the goal of long term housing stability.  Many of the clients of Housing First are chronically homeless, or have been without stable accommodations for many months. While the definition of how long that time-frame needs to be will vary by administering agency and county, a priority will usually be for those applicants that have been homeless for 6 months or more. There is also an emphasis on individuals with a significant barrier that they need to overcome.   HUD emphasizes assistance goes to applicants with drug or alcohol issues to help overcome their addiction, the disabled, whether from a physical condition, chronic illness, or mental condition, and veterans.  Many county and city governments rely on Community Action Programs to address this homelessness crisis.   Our Rapid Re-Housing uses the Coordinated Entry Pre-Screen system:  Coordinated Entry means 'no wrong door'. If you need housing assistance, rather than apply at several agencies you can complete a pre-screen form to determine eligibility for multiple housing programs in Wood, Marathon, and Lincoln Counties.   Based on your current situation and level of need, you will be referred to the prioritization list. If/when a program has an available housing opportunity, the person or family with the greatest level of need will be contacted and advised of the opening.
